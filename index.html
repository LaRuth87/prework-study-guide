        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The <ul>, <ol>, and <li> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element. </li>
          <li>The <body> element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. </li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Speaking of the hyperlink, the <a> element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from <h1> to <h6> to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,<h1>, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>

        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the parentheses. For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.
      Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. To learn more about the Math object properties and methods, visit the MDN Web Docs on MathLinks to an external site..</li>
      <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. To learn more about truthy and falsy values, visit the MDN Web Docs on truthyLinks to an external site..</li>
